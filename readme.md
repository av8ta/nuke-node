# nuke-node

Delete node, npm, and nvm

destructive as fuck. be careful

## usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/av8ta/nuke-node
cd nuke-node
chmod +x nuke-node.sh
./nuke-node.sh
```

destructively deletes files, folders, and executables associated with the nodejs ecosystem

does ask if you're sure and does backup any changed profile files such as `~/.bashrc` is backed up to `~/.bashrc.nuke_backup`, but that's all the safety you get.

## use at your own risk

don't worry you'll be fine!
